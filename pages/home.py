            Welcome to this Intro to Python notes collection! It was designed as a quick reference for the basics of Python. Each page has a different set of topics and contains examples and questions to test your understanding.

            The chapters can be selected from the sidebar on the left. If you can't see it, there should be a button in the top left corner of the page that looks like \">>\". This sidebar is collapsible, so you can collapse it if you want to.

            The chapters are as follows:
            - 00\. Home
            - 01\. Setup
            - 02\. Variables and Data Types

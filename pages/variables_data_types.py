            A variable is what we use to store information in a program. If the information can be represented as some sort of tangible value or object (e.g. a number or some text), then we can store in a variable. For Python to understand the information being stored, it has specific data types that it can work with. The core three are `int`, `float`, and `str`.

            `int` and `float` are used to store numbers. `int` is used to store **int**eger values, while `float` is used to store **float**ing point values (decimal numbers). An example of an `int` is `1`, while an example of a `float` is `1.5`. Note that as long as the number has a decimal point, it will be stored as a `float`, even if the number itself could be rewritten as an `int` (e.g. `1.0` is a `float` even though 1 does not inherently have a fractional part).

# String data type
st.header("String data type")
st.markdown("""
            `str` is used to store **string** values. A string is a sequence of characters. An example of a `str` is `"Hello, world!"`. Notice the use of quotes to indicate that the value is a string. These quotes are not part of the string itself, but are used to indicate that the value is a string. Without these quotes, Python would think you are typing some code instead. Also notice that the quotes can be single or double quotes, but they must be consistent (i.e. the string must be enclosed in the same type of quotes).
            """)
st.markdown("""
            **Note 1:** A string can be empty, which is represented by two quotes with nothing in between. For example, `""` is a valid `str` value.

            **Note 2:** A string cannot *contain* the same quote character that is used to enclose the string. For example, `"Hello, world!"` is a valid `str` because the string is enclosed in double quotes, but `"Hello, world!"` is not a valid `str` because the string is enclosed in double quotes and contains a double quote.

# Variable assignment

            To store these values in a variable, the variable needs to be created and assigned. The syntax for this is:

            variable_name = value
            ```

Notice that the variable name is on the left side of the assignment operator (`=`) and the value is on the right side. This is *always* the case, and is a key concept to remember when programming.

            Note that if a variable is written on the right side, then it is assumed that we want to assign the *value* of that variable to the variable on the left. For example, if we have `x = 1` and `y = x`, then `y` will be assigned the value `1`.

# Casting to a different data type
st.header("Typecasting")
st.markdown("""
            We can also convert between data types using the `int()`, `float()`, and `str()` functions. This is particularly useful when we want to do something with a value that is only possible for certain data types. For example, we can use `int()` to conver a string into an integer, so we can do math.

            These three functions return an entirely new value, and do not modify the original value that they are called on. For example, if we have `x = '123'` and we call `int(x)`, then `x` will still be `'123'` and the function will return `123` (the integer value of the string `'123'`).

            The table below shows the possible conversions:

st.markdown("""
            When converting a string to a number, just think about whether the value looks like a number if you remove the quotes. For example, `\"123\"` without the quotes is `123`, which is an integer. This means you can convert to both an `int` and a `float`.

            When converting a `float` to an `int`, the decimal point and anything after it is removed. For example, `int(1.9999)` will return `1`. When converting any number to a string, just add quotes around the number. For example, `str(1.0)` will return `\"1.0\"`.

st.subheader("Most Common Mistake")
st.markdown("""
            We know that converting a `float` to an `int` will remove the decimal point and anything after it, but what happens if you try to convert a string that contains a decimal number to an `int`? An error occurs!

            When you convert a string to an `int`, you need to see if the value without the quotes is an integer. For example, `\"123.45\"` without the quotes is `123.45`, which is not an integer. This means that `int(\"123.45\")` will return an error. Do not make the assumption that `int()` will also truncate the decimal point for you. You would need to convert to a `float` first and then to an `int` to get the integer part of the number. Below shows the side by side comparison of the incorrect and correct way to do this conversion.

            ```python
            # Incorrect
            int(\"123.45\")

            # Correct
            int(float(\"123.45\"))

            The other mistake people do is not assigning the new value to a variable. When you convert the type, it stores the new value. However, you need to store it yourself in a variable if you want to use it later:

            # Can't use this value later
            str(123)

            With that code snippet, `x` will hold onto `\"123\"`, and we can use it later.

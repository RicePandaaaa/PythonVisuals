            Loops are a fundamental concept in programming. They allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. There are two types of loops in Python: `for` loops and `while` loops.

            A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g. a string) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence. It is also commonly used to execute a block of code a specific number of times.

            A `while` loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met. The number of times the code is executed is not known beforehand, unlike a `for` loop.

            Be sure to note this difference very carefully: a `for` loop is used when you know exactly how many times you want to do something no matter what while a `while` loop is used when you only know the condition for the loop to continue.

st.subheader("`for` loops")

st.markdown("""
            `for` loops are used to iterate over a sequence (e.g. a string) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.

            The general syntax of a `for` loop is:
            ```python
            for item in sequence:
                # code to execute for each item in the sequence
            ```

            Note the indentation of the code block. It is very important to indent the code block correctly. Only code that is indented directly after the `for` loop will be looped over. Code not indented will be treated as outside of the loop. Also, don't forget the colon at the end of the `for` loop line!

            `item` is usually a variable local to the loop, and it is used to hold the current item in the sequence. It does not need to be created beforehand. In most cases, it's actually preferred that you don't create the variable beforehand because it can cause confusion. If you use a pre-existing variable, the loop will change the value of the variable.

            `sequence` is the sequence you want to iterate over. It can be a string, but for now, it's most common to be a `range()`. `in` is just required to be there. Don't worry too much about what exactly it does, just know that it's required.

st.subheader("`range()`")

st.markdown("""
            `range()` is a built-in function that returns a sequence of numbers. It is commonly used in `for` loops.

            The general syntax of `range()` is:
            ```python
            range(start, stop, step)
            ```

            `start` is the starting number of the sequence. It defaults to 0. `stop` is the ending number of the sequence. It is not included in the sequence. `step` is the difference between each number in the sequence. It defaults to 1. For example, `range(1, 10, 2)` will return `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`. 

            `step` also has an additional rule: it cannot be 0, ever. All three parameters must also be integers. If any of them are not integers, you will get an error.

            Note that since `start` defaults to 0 and `step` defaults to 1, you can actually just put in one number into `range()` and it will return a sequence of numbers from 0 to that number. For example, `range(10)` will return `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. 
            
            This is incredibly useful if you know how many times you want to loop. Note that `range(n)` will generate a list from 0 to n-1, which is a list of `n` numbers. What does this mean? You can use a `for` loop to just do something `n` times, even if you don't care about the loop variable!

            For example, if you want to `print("Hi")` 10 times, you can do:
            ```python
            for _ in range(10):
                print("Hi")
            ```
            
            The usage of `_` is a convention to indicate that the loop variable is not used. It's a throwaway variable. However, you can just name it something else, such as `i` (arguably the most common loop variable name). Note that `_` actually does store the current number the loop is on, but it doesn't have to be used. It's just there in case you need it (and also because the syntax demands the existance of a loop variable).

            For an example of actually using the loop variable, we can make a simple star pyramid:
            ```python
            for i in range(6):
                print("*" * i)
            ```
            
            Remember that a string multiplied by an integer will repeat the string that many times. So in this case, `"*" * i` will repeat the `"*"` character `i` times. As the loop variable `i` goes from 0 to 5, the number of stars will increase from 0 to 5, creating a pyramid made out of stars (the `*` is the star). Also remember that the `stop` number is not included in the sequence, so the last line has 6-1, or 5 stars.

            Output:
            ```

            *
            **
            ***
            ****
            *****
            ```

            The empty line is due to the 0 star line (0 stars means there's just nothing in that line).

st.subheader("Advanced `range()` usages")

st.markdown("""
            `range()` can be defined using just two numbers, the `start` and `stop`. The `step` defaults to 1. For example, `range(10, 20)` will return `[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]`. This isn't exactly very advanced, but it's good to know that you can provide one, two, or all three numbers to `range()`.

            `range()` can also be used to create a sequence of numbers in reverse. For example, `range(10, 0, -1)` will return `[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

            You can also use a negative `step` to create a sequence of numbers in reverse. For example, `range(10, 0, -2)` will return `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`. Note that if `step` is positive, then the loop only works if `start < stop`. If `start > stop`, then the loop will not run at all, because `start` already exceeds `stop`. The same thing happens if `step` is negative. If `start < stop`, then the loop will not run at all, because `start` is already less than `stop`.

            As code examples, these two `for` loops will never run:
            ```python
            # step > 0, start > stop
            for i in range(10, 0, 1):
                print("Hi")

            # step < 0, start < stop
            for i in range(0, 10, -1):
                print("Hi")
            ```
